# Qrcode: Remake

![Showcase](./showcase.png)

## About the Work

This original work was created in September 2019. The intention was to create a simple and easy-to-use QR Code generator that does not collect user data.

In this project, the QR code is generated using the [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) library by davidshimjs.



The remake restores the functionality of the original while adding support for dark mode and adopting updated technologies.

## What's New

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

## What's Removed
